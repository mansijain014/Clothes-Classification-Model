# Clothes-Classification-Model

## Introduction
Trained a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts using tensorflow & keras.
## Dataset 
This uses the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels), as seen here:
